Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Flight Risk and I don't even know where to start. Do you ever just sit there and wonder if maybe you’re the idiot for liking something everyone else is sure to criticize? Yeah, that’s where I’m at right now. Like, it was the type of   where I kept waiting for something to blow my mind, and then... it didn't? But maybe it did? It's all tangled up in my head.

Absolute chaos, that  . At times, the dude on-screen was just being a complete idiot and I wanted to walk in, slap him with a sandwich, and ask how many brain cells he has left. But then—just BAM—something happens, and my heart's doing gymnastics. Maybe it's the tiredness kicking in, or maybe I'm losing it, but right now, everything seems both dumb and genius. It’s messy, like spilling a can of soda on a painting but still pretending it's art.

> The visuals were... there? I dunno. Some shots looked like they were 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ed through a potato with aspirations, and in others, it felt like they dunked the camera in gold glitter. It had that roller coaster pep without the stomach churning, and let’s just say this whole Flight Risk thing was a bumpy ride in more ways than one.

And I can't figure out if the main character was supposed to be charismatic or just a typical action hero cut-out gone wrong. Do I want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again just to figure it all out? Possibly? There was this massive plot twist that felt like a lukewarm soda after running: unexpected, not entirely welcome, but kind of what you needed at that very moment.

Here's what today's confusion spit out in code form:

```javascript
if (flightRisk) {
  mainCharacter.mistakes++;
  if (audience.isConfused) { 
    plotTwist();
  }
}
```

It doesn't make sense, right? Yeah, kind of like the  .

So, do yourself a favor: don't overthink it. It's neither a masterpiece nor a total dud. Go see it just to figure out if I'm crazy or if the   is. Anyway, I'm off to apologize to my brain for making it over-analyze what's probably just a popcorn flick with a misleading title.
